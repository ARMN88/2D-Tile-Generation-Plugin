# <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0c/Blender_logo_no_text.svg/939px-Blender_logo_no_text.svg.png" height="30vh"> Blender Tile Generation Addon
An addon for Blender that allows users to procedurally create tile based maps. You can download the blender file attached, or follow the steps below to create your own setup.

## How To Use
### Import The Addon
Download `generation.py`. Open your Blender file, and go do `Edit > Preferences > Addons > Install`. Import `generation.py`.

### Create Tiles
This is a very crucial part that can be easily messed up. You will need to create 11 different tiles in a specific order with a specific shape and orientation.

### Run The Algorithm
After creating your tiles, go to `Object` in the upper right hand corner of the viewport. At the bottom, you will see two generators. Select one, and it will generate a map using its corresponding method. Immediately after generating, you will see a panel in the bottom left corner of the viewport. This will allow you to change the generation to your liking. All generated tiles will be added to a new collection called `Tiles`.
